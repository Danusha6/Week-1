            <p>I'm 21 years old. I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I'm an emerging professional in the field of Application development at Year Up Pugent Sound. I have a passion for creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. With a couple of months experience in the industry, I have gained valuable knowledge in HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript and Python, which makes me constantly updating to stay ahead of the curve. I believe that this field of study is growning and in high demand.</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about learning new skills and knowledge, teamwork and problem-solving. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading self development and psychology books, spending time with my family and friends, watching movie and listening to spiritual music. And when I get more time I like to travel to different part of the world. I also love meeting new people, experiencing new culture, and trying to learn different language.</p>
